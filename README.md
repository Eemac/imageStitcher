# MATLAB Image Stitcher
This repository contains an image stitching pipeline written entirely in MATLAB without the use of image-processing toolkits. More details about implementation can be found in the final report and presentation linked below. The repository contains the following files:

Image Snipper.mlx - this creates clips from the test images for use in reconstruction and should be run first
Animated_Final_Improved.mlx - this reconstructs the original image from the clips and should be run second
*.m - all functions are documented internally
